#MotionKit
A nice and clean wrapper for the **CoreMotion Framework**. The Core Motion framework lets your application receive motion data from device hardware and process that data.
The data can be retrieved from **Accelerometer**, **Gyroscope** and **Magnetometer**.
You can also get the *composited gyroscope and accelerometer data* from the **deviceMotion** datatype itself instead of using raw *Gyroscope* or *Accelerometer*.
